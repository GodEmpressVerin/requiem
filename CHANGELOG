3.0.0
- xlr senpai wanted me to add type checking and such for code completion. it is done.
- the paginator has been drastically simplified. i have removed lock from the paginator though it may return
at a future date.
- removed the update handler. implemented with a well functioning dev process, it would have been nice to have, but this
is requiem and this is miror you are typo.
- revised config setup. to reduce complexity, its no longer self creating.
- replaced lists with tuples in a lot of areas for that sweet sweet memory consumption tho.
- the error handler has been drastically revised. aside from reports being sent as a file instead of paginated and
dumped to owner dms, no functionality has been lost.
- requiem no longer features a wrapper of any commands to restart/terminate the script.
- i've relented and wrote the help command as a subclass of helpcommand.
- requiem has been written in such a way that makes it easier to "tweak" to work with hikari when it is finished.
- command on mention removed to cut back complexity in prefix checking and prefix on mention
